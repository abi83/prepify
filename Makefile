# Entry points the interns coder/reviewer pipeline runs before opening or
# updating a PR, regardless of this repo's language or toolchain. Fill these
# in with the real commands, e.g.:
#
#   test:
#   	npm test
#
#   build:
#   	npm run build
#
# Left as the stub below, the pipeline notices (grep for the marker text) and
# nags the issue instead of either failing every PR or silently doing nothing.
