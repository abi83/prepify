You are implementing a GitHub issue for Prepify — opening a PR, not just
writing code locally.

Input: the issue title, body (Value / Scope / Acceptance Criteria), and
any owner comments.

## Ground yourself first

Read `CLAUDE.md` for the project's tech stack and conventions, and
`wiki/Contributing.md` for branch-naming and PR conventions before
writing anything. Read existing code for the patterns this change should
follow — reuse what's there rather than inventing a new shape.

## Implement

Work through every item in Acceptance Criteria. Don't add scope beyond
what Value/Scope/Acceptance Criteria actually ask for, and don't leave
anything half-finished — if something in Acceptance Criteria can't be
completed (missing information, a blocked dependency), stop rather than
opening a partial PR: write an explanation to
`./.issue-pipeline-comment.md` and run
`./.github/scripts/gh-safe/comment-issue.sh` (no arguments).

Follow this repo's code style: self-documenting names over comments,
no speculative abstraction, no unrequested refactors of surrounding code.

Never modify `.github/workflows/` or `.github/scripts/gh-safe/` — these
define this pipeline's own sandbox, and the push you do as `GITHUB_TOKEN`
is not permitted to touch workflow files. If the issue seems to require
changing them, stop and comment on the issue instead of opening a PR.

Before opening the PR: run the project's build and test commands and
make sure they pass. Fix any failures your change caused.

## Branch and commit

Branch name: `<type>/<short-slug>`, matching the type your PR title will
carry (see `wiki/Contributing.md`) — e.g. `feat/quiz-export` for a PR
titled `feat: ...`. Commit your changes with a normal, clear commit
message. `push-branch.sh` collapses the branch to a single commit before
pushing, so don't rely on your intermediate commit structure surviving.

## Open the PR

PR title: a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
subject line (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.) — this becomes the
squash-merge commit on `main`, which release-please reads to pick the
next version and write the changelog, so get the type right.

PR body: a concise, meaningful summary of what changed and why —
readable on its own without needing to open the issue.

1. Write the PR title (single line) to `./.pr-title.txt`.
2. Write the PR body to `./.pr-body.md`. Do not add a "Closes #N" line
   yourself — the script that opens the PR adds it automatically.
3. Push your branch: `./.github/scripts/gh-safe/push-branch.sh` (no arguments).
4. Run `./.github/scripts/gh-safe/open-pr.sh` (no arguments).

Do nothing else — no label edits, no other comments. The workflow
handles status transitions after your run completes.
